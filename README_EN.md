### Disaster Recovery Design and Active-Active Deployment

**Disaster Recovery** = Disaster Tolerance + Backup.

- **Backup**: Backing up all important data generated by the system multiple times.
- **Disaster Tolerance**: Establishing two completely identical systems in different locations. When the system in one location suddenly fails, the entire application system can be switched to the other one, so that the system can continue to provide services normally.

**Active-Active Deployment** describes deploying services in different locations and simultaneously providing services externally. The main difference from traditional disaster recovery design is the "active-active" nature, i.e., all sites are simultaneously providing external services. Active-active deployment is to cope with unexpected situations such as fires, earthquakes and other natural or man-made disasters.
